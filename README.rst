Sahara image elements project (Spark experimental fork)
=======================================================

This repository has been forked to develop the Spark support in Sahara. The images created with this version of the DIB
should be used together with the Sahara version available here: https://github.com/bigfootproject/sahara

The changes from the upstream repository include:

- support for more recent versions of Spark
- Use the Cloudera element to install HDFS from CDH 5.3
- Install Spark Notebook along with Spark
- Other non-Spark elements and image types to support project related to `Bigfoot <http://bigfootproject.eu>`_

To create images for Spark on CDH4 HDFS and for all the other Sahara plugins use the standard Sahara DIB.

You should only need to run this command:

.. sourcecode:: bash

    tox -e venv -- sahara-image-create

Note: More information about script `diskimage-create <https://github.com/openstack/sahara-image-elements/blob/master/diskimage-create/README.rst>`_

This research work is part of the Bigfoot project: http://bigfootproject.eu/
